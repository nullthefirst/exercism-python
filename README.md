I started this repository during a period in time, where I sought to switch my primary professional focus to business. It served (and might yet still do so) the task of keeping my developer mind fit. I practice coding challenges in a documentable and consistent fashion, to present avenues for product creation after my tutelage in the principles of corporate choreography.
